### PHP PHPCodeSniffer with PSR-2 Standard (pre-commit hook)
In order to make ```Quack```'s development easier, it is required you to install this __PSR-2__ hook for ```git```. This tool __evaluates__ the quality of your code together with the ```phpcs```. 

That will help us to make better code and reduce code refactoring in the future.

### Requirements
- ```Bash```
- ```PHPCodeSniffer```

### How to install

- ```cd path/to/quack/tools/phpcs-pre-commit```
- ```bash install.sh```
 
### How to use
That happens automatically when you commit your code.
